# University of Michigan Python Specialization - Final Assessments 

This repository contains my final assignments from the University of Michigan's Python Specialization. These assignments cover a range of topics within Python programming, focusing on applied machine learning, text mining, and data science with Python. Each Jupyter notebook is a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout each course. 
Please note: I am currently pursuing the specialization , and this repository is actively updated with new projects and assessments.
